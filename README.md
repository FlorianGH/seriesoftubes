# Series of Tubes

**Build the internet, one tube at a time.** A free cartoon browser game about how
the internet really works. Play it at **[seriesoftub.es](https://seriesoftub.es)**.

![Series of Tubes](site/images/og-image.png)

You start with one router in one city and grow into a transit-free Tier 1:

- **Customers:** home broadband ("eyeballs"), enterprises, hosting, L2VPNs, DDoS
  protection, high-frequency traders with latency budgets, AI GPU data centers and
  hyperscaler DCI deals. Some come with very specific requirements.
- **Interconnection:** IP transit billed on the 95th percentile, internet exchanges
  with route servers, open/selective/restrictive/paid peering, PNIs, embedded CDN
  caches, and NNI fabrics for virtual circuits and remote peering.
- **Infrastructure:** leased waves on around 40 subsea cable systems modelled on real ones,
  dark fiber (leased or self-built) lit with DWDM and ZR+ optics, router
  generations that cap your port speeds, and LAGs to bundle ports when one isn't enough.
- **Traffic engineering:** see exactly what fills each link, tune link metrics and
  egress preferences, and route traders over the fastest path and backups the scenic way.
- **Things break, constantly:** backhoes, sharks, fat fingers, route leaks, RPKI
  mishaps, DDoS, cooling failures, Red Sea and Baltic cable cuts, sanctions and
  sovereign internet drills.

Every company is a pun. No real company names are used.

## Learn how it really works

This game simplifies a lot, and gets some things gloriously wrong on purpose. For
the real thing, go to **[How the Internet Works](https://tkjaer.github.io/how-the-internet-works/)**
by Thomas Kjær Aabo ([source](https://github.com/tkjaer/how-the-internet-works)):
an interactive, zoomable map that follows your data from Wi-Fi and copper to
undersea fiber, as the internet works today, in 2010 and in 1995, with simple or
technical explanations. If you enjoy Series of Tubes, you will learn more from
an hour there than from a year of laying cartoon fiber here.

## Playing locally

It is a single static page, assembled from the files in `src/` by a small Node script:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:8080
```

Progress is saved in your browser's local storage.

The game speaks English, Italian, Portuguese and French. It follows your browser's language the first time
and remembers the one you pick under Settings or on the title screen.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev    # development server: assembles src/ on every request, reloads on save
npm test       # headless tests: boot, geography, a year of play, every incident, every panel
npm run build  # writes the site for GitHub Pages to _site/, with version and date stamped in
npm run i18n:check  # lists text missing from (or stale in) the translations
```

```
src/                   the game page, in pieces (joined into one index.html at build)
  index.html           the shell: <head>, static markup, @include lines
  i18n/en.js           English for every label, inlined into the page
  styles/              CSS
  game/                the game script, by topic: world, networks, simulation, actions, UI, map…
site/                  static files, deployed as they are
  i18n/it.js           Italian translation (label → text), loaded only when the game runs in Italian
  i18n/pt.js           Portuguese (Brazil) translation, loaded only when the game runs in Portuguese
  i18n/fr.js           French translation, loaded only when the game runs in French
  images/og-image.png  social preview (1200×630)
  favicon.*, icon-*    favicons, app icons, manifest
  sw.js                service worker (offline play)
  robots.txt, sitemap.xml, llms.txt, 404.html, CNAME
scripts/build.js       builds _site/ for GitHub Pages: site/ + the assembled page, stamped
scripts/lib/page.js    joins src/ into the page
tests/                 node:test + jsdom
docs/                  architecture and decisions (docs/adr/)
.github/workflows/     ci.yml (pushes to main and PRs) and release.yml (GitHub Pages deploy)
```

## Translations

Player-facing text is keyed by label, and English is a dictionary like the others. Code says
`tr('pnis.ready_in_about_n_days', {n})` (or `trn('save.n_pop', n)` for plurals); static markup uses
`data-i18n="label"`. The English is in `src/i18n/en.js`, inlined into the page; each other language is
a `site/i18n/<lang>.js` file mapping the same labels to its text, plus an entry in `SOT_LANGS` (the
language loader in `src/index.html`). Missing translations fall back to English, so new text never
breaks the game; `npm run i18n:check` lists what needs translating, and the tests make sure every
translation keeps its `{placeholders}`, HTML tags and plural forms.

## Releasing

Only published releases reach [seriesoftub.es](https://seriesoftub.es). Ordinary
pushes to `main` run CI and nothing else; a version bump is the release button.

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (semver) and rename the changelog's
   `[Unreleased]` section to `## [<version>] — <date>`. Write the bullets for
   players: the build turns that section into the in-game "What's new" card and
   into `/version.json`, which open games poll to offer a reload.
2. Push or merge to `main`.

The **Auto-release** workflow then runs the tests, tags `v<version>`, publishes a
GitHub release with that changelog section as notes, and starts the deploy. It
does nothing when the tag already exists, and refuses a version older than the
latest release or one without changelog notes. A version with a pre-release
suffix (`1.2.0-beta.1`) becomes a pre-release and is not deployed. You can still
publish a release by hand; the deploy runs the same way.

The release workflow checks that the tag matches `package.json`, runs the tests,
builds, deploys to GitHub Pages and pings IndexNow. It refuses to build when the
CHANGELOG has no `## [<version>]` section (rename `[Unreleased]` first).
Pre-releases never deploy, also not when run by hand, and a version older than
the live one is refused unless you tick `allow_older` (a deliberate rollback).
To redeploy an existing release, run the workflow manually with its tag.

## Hosting setup

GitHub Pages serves the site with **Source: GitHub Actions** and the custom domain
`seriesoftub.es`. Releases deploy from tags, so in **Settings → Environments →
github-pages → Deployment branches and tags**, add a tag rule for `v*` (by default
only the default branch may deploy). DNS for the apex domain:

```
seriesoftub.es.        A     185.199.108.153
seriesoftub.es.        A     185.199.109.153
seriesoftub.es.        A     185.199.110.153
seriesoftub.es.        A     185.199.111.153
seriesoftub.es.        AAAA  2606:50c0:8000::153
seriesoftub.es.        AAAA  2606:50c0:8001::153
seriesoftub.es.        AAAA  2606:50c0:8002::153
seriesoftub.es.        AAAA  2606:50c0:8003::153
www.seriesoftub.es.    CNAME fjaeckel.github.io.
stats.seriesoftub.es.  CNAME seocho.jc-ix.net.
```

Once DNS resolves, enable **Enforce HTTPS** in the repository's Pages settings.

## Analytics

The game uses [Ridiculytics](https://github.com/fjaeckel/ridiculytics): cookieless,
no persistent identifiers, self-hosted at `stats.seriesoftub.es`. It only reports
from `seriesoftub.es` itself; local copies, previews and forks stay silent. The
script is pinned to `ridiculytics@1.0.1` with an SRI hash.

Besides page views and session length, the game sends a few coarse events, all
under the collector's 50-name cap: `game_new`, `game_continue`, `play_1m` …
`play_120m` (active, unpaused play time), `goal_<id>`, `level_2`–`level_4`,
`game_year_2/3/5`, `win_tier1` and `bankrupt`.

The collector must allow the site, e.g. in `sites.yaml`:

```yaml
sites:
  - domain: seriesoftub.es
    origins: ["https://seriesoftub.es", "https://www.seriesoftub.es"]
```

## Community

Come hang out in the **[Series of Tubes Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIJwvEt5fYt1pvw7J2pV664CyUyGJXmAJLV8ia3nUdAD7EhA_FzdxflEzkNmcvDHdVgLQ)**. Share screenshots of your
network, report bugs, suggest cities, and argue about peering policy with other players.
There are fewer backhoes there than in the real thing.
